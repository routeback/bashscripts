# Desc: Quickly retrieve Internet accessible data from a list of hosts for OSINT purposes.
#
###

# Below: Extreme scope-creep of what this tool was intended for and what is has since  become.
#
# TODO: Re-write the script as functions that are called through positional parameters
# EX:	--dns
#	--whois
#	--cms
#	--robots,sitemap,content-discovery
#	--all
#	--output filename
#
	# This can allow the tool to work well for internals as well by ignoring whois checks etc. by only using local scanning functions w/ Nmap etc. and by specifying an internal DNS server for name resolution. 
	# Additionally, this tool can have internal specific functions like NBTScan, broadcast scanning etc. However, this may overlap with existing tooling such as Discover and Rumble and may not be necessary, though having a single functioning script with minimal setup that is easily portable can be of value.
# 
# Add identification of backend CMS / Robots.txt, Sitemap.xml, Combine w/ RAWR, script out scan test for SSLChecks
#
# Database integration and thoughts - Data aggregation and correlation
	# Log each command that is executed and use a primary key ID value to associate it with the expected output, if expected output is null, then re-run command where key ID = n
	# Separate DB gap analysis script, allows you to re-scan the DB following all executed tasks, identify missing fields and attempt to retrieve them once more.
	# If secondary attempt fails, do not try again and flag bit for manual review.
	# Continue this methodology with fingerprinting services and manually reviewing them.
	# Implementation: set -x can reveal command, or find a way to pull the local history within the subshell and log it. Will have to grep the $i hostname to identify legit commands and assign them a new primary key.
#
# Logging & Reference Data / History
	# Find a way to then store historical values for each cell, run these scans on a regular interval, and then send email diff's and screenshots of content or headers etc. that changed
	# Also tie this in with subdomain bruting and other new host detection scripts, automatically adding those hosts into the in-scope asset monitoring pool
	# Monitor webheaders and other parameters for changes to notify of newly deployed software.
	 # for i in $(cat $1)
	 # do echo "Connecting to $i" >> web_headers.txt
	 # curl -k -L -s -I $i -m 5 >> web_headers.txt

#
# Implement a CTRL+Break catch at any point in the script to prompt the user with y/n and enter to actually quit, otherwise it will continue to prevent accidental cancellation.
#
# Efficiency: Make a Wordpress scanner (xmlrpc, wp-login, Wordpress headers etc.) to identify if a site is WP based or not, then use those hosts for CMSmap and add -f W parameter.
# cmsmap -o cmsmap_scans/$i.cmsmap -s -d -a "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36" http://$i
# echo "[*] CMSmap completed. Check cmsmap_scans/$i.cmsmap file for details." | tee -a $filename
#
# Most important data points to extract from nmap output and log to DB:
	# rDNS record for 127.0.0.1: example.com - 				# If new IP / Domain, add to a manual scope review list, then re-scan if necessary.
	# PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
	# 443/tcp open  ssl/http nginx 1.x.x
	# |_http-server-header: nginx/1.x.x
	# | ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=example2.com
	# | Subject Alternative Name: DNS:example.com, DNS:www.example3.com
#
# Automated reporting should be a default and expected feature of the tool for manually reviewing and editing data.
# Final output of all tools should be XML for simple parsing.
# Next step of this project may be parsing the $filename for [*] and then formatting it to XML, then creating a custom XSL and rendering it, which can then be copy/pasted into Word as a table or used with Markdown to generate a PDF.
#
# Create a separate script for scanning ports and services once scope is finalized
#	- Just use Discover, but find a way to run it without the TUI, how can you supply all the parameters it needs from CLI and run MSF auxiliaries etc?
#	- If not possible, just instruct the user to next run discover and provide the path: /opt/discover/discover.sh
# Once all banners are retrieved, use searchsploit equivalent GO tool and provide list of CVE's to inspect and high priority targets
#
# Separate output to individual hostnames, change loops to output to hostname.all_tool_appended_output instead of a single flat file.
