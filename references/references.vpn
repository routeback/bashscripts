If you want all of your traffic to come from the VPN server directly, there is a key setting to be aware of:

redirect-gateway def1

To implent the gateway redirection, you have a couple options:

You can add an option to your lab-vpn.conf file: 
  - redirect-gateway def1
You can include this option when you start openvpn:
  - openvpn --config lab-vpn.conf --redirect-gateway
